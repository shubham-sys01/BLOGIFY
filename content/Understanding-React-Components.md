React components are the building blocks of any React application. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

## Functional Components

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are simple, easy to test, and encourage the use of hooks for state and side effects.

### Advantages

- Easier to read and test
- Encourage the use of hooks
- Less boilerplate

## Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They can hold and manage their own state and lifecycle methods.

### When to Use

- When you need lifecycle methods
- When managing complex state

## Key Differences
```
| Feature            | Functional Components| Class Components  |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Syntax             | Function             | Class             |
| State              | useState Hook        | this.state        |
| Lifecycle Methods  | useEffect Hook       | Lifecycle methods |
| Boilerplate        | Minimal              | More              |

```

## Conclusion

Both functional and class components have their place in React development. However, with the introduction of hooks, functional components are now the preferred way to write components in modern React applications.
