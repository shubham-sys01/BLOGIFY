## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful **React framework** that enables developers to build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications.  
It combines the flexibility of React with additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and more.  

This guide will help you get started with Next.js, from setup to deployment.

## Why Choose Next.js?

- **SEO Friendly**: Server-rendered pages are easily indexed by search engines.
- **Performance**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and caching.
- **Built-in Routing**: No need for external routing libraries.
- **Full-Stack Support**: API routes let you create backend logic in the same project.
- **Developer Experience**: Fast refresh, TypeScript support, and more.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications. Follow these steps to set up a new Next.js project from scratch.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Create a New Next.js App

You can quickly create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app

yarn create next-app my-next-app
```
Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name.

### 2. Navigate to Your Project Directory
```
cd my-next-app
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```
Your application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. Explore the Project Structure

- `pages/` - Contains your application's pages. Each file in this directory becomes a route.
- `public/` - Static assets like images.
- `styles/` - CSS files for styling your app.
- `next.config.js` - Configuration file for customizing your Next.js setup.

### 5. Edit Your First Page

Open `pages/index.js` in your code editor and start editing. The page will automatically update as you save the file.

### 6. Build and Export

To create an optimized production build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
To start the production server:
```bash
npm run build
```
