## Introduction

Git is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world.  
Whether you’re a developer, designer, or content creator, Git can help you track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back mistakes with ease.  
This guide will walk you through the basics so you can start using Git confidently.

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)**.  
This means every contributor has a complete copy of the project history, allowing for offline work and powerful branching.

With Git, you can:
- Track every change to your files
- Revert to previous versions
- Work on multiple features in parallel using branches
- Merge contributions from different people without overwriting each other’s work
